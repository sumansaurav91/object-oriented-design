* Class : A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.
```
class Person
{
  string country = "India";
}
```
* Object: It is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming and represents the real life entities.
```
class Person
{
  string country = "India";
  
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Person person = new Person();
    Console.WriteLine(person.country);
  }
}
```
