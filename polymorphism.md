# Polymorphism

* Allows an object to have several different forms and behaviors.

## Types of Polymorphism

* Dynamic
    * Method Overriding
    
* Static
    * Method Overloading
    * Operator Overloading

## Method Overriding - Dynamic Polymorphism

* If a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that has already been defined in one of its parent classes, it is known as method overloading.

## Method Overloading - Static Polymorphism

* If a class had one or more method with same name but either number of argument is different or the types of argument is different.
